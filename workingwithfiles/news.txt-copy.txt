As per a Financial Times report, the tune-pumping add-on is going to offer voice control capabilities and cost you about $100 (that's roughly Â£75 or AU$140). It'll sync with your car stereo via Bluetooth, apparently, and offer quick access to your favorite playlists, though it doesn't appear to have a touchscreen or any display of its own.
